    "### Business Context\n",
    "You are working as a data analyst for an e-commerce logistics company that aims to improve its delivery performance and customer satisfaction.  \n",
    "Recently, management noticed an increasing number of **late shipments**, which negatively impacts repeat purchases and customer loyalty.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, the analytics team collected operational data for several hundred shipments, including details such as:\n",
    "- Shipping mode (e.g., road, flight, ship)\n",
    "- Warehouse block\n",
    "- Product cost and discount\n",
    "- Customer service calls\n",
    "- Package weight and prior purchase history\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to use **predictive analytics** to understand what factors contribute to on-time delivery and to **build a simple, interpretable classification model** using **Naive Bayes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Objective\n",
    "Develop a model that predicts whether a product shipment will arrive **on time** or **delayed**, based on its shipping and customer features.  \n",
    "The model will support:\n",
    "- Early identification of risky shipments  \n",
    "- Operational optimization (e.g., route selection, discount policies)  \n",
    "- Customer experience improvement\n",
